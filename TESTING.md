## List of bugs and issues
1. Background image was not adjusting as per content on top of it.
    #### Fix:
    - Set height to 100vh.

2. The main label was set to absolute which was causing it to fall on invalid position on different screens.
    #### Fix:
    - Set position to relative

3. The username logo keeps moving to right on result screen.
    #### Fix:
    - Set position to absolute for username logo.
    
4. The text box get overflowed from left on small screens.
    #### Fix:
    - inside media query set width to -webkit-fill-available.

5. Inside result section the header merges with the username logo.
    #### Fix:
    - Clear on both side was required one for username logo and other for timer.

6. The timer function was not working at all. What I was getting was skipping of multiple seconds in one second after every question.
    #### Fix:
     - Used the solution provided in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4435776/simple-clock-that-counts-down-from-30-seconds-and-executes-a-function-afterward) and modified it later in program

7. I had no idea how to make an array change its sequence randomly after each iteration.
    #### Fix:
    - I used the solution provided by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=1316s) you tuber.

9. Currently there is an issue of "Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'."
    #### Fix:
    - Requires no fix as this caused by Google's initiative (FLoC).

10. I accidently put every event inside a for loop that caused multiple error.
    #### Fix:
    - Removed the for loop as it was not required anyway and move events in their locations.

11. There were a few question where I didn't set the valid solution which caused unexpected behaviors.
    #### Fix:
    - Remove multiple correct answers set in list and set valid answers where not set.

12. The username textarea was taking long strings as input.
    #### Fix:
    - Limit username length by 10 inside input tag.
